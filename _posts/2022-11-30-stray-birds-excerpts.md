[《飞鸟集》](https://book.douban.com/subject/4243288/)(Stray Birds)是印度诗人泰戈尔最家喻户晓的作品之一，其中包含了325首小诗。词句清新、想象瑰丽，虽无法谈及中国古典诗词的所谓诗意，但仍可窥见一位浪漫诗人眼中的绚烂世界。

其时常在视频网站中浏览到英文书法相关的视频，每每看到流畅的笔触和秀丽的字迹总感到意犹未尽、跃跃欲试。正值《诗经》的阅读告一段落，心中仍有对诗词的留恋，因而着眼于《飞鸟集》，并将其用作英文书法的练习材料。后从2022.11.11起，历经三个月左右的时间，于2023.01.19将全325首小诗以抄写的形式读罢。摘录了一些颇有感触的篇目，并尝试自拟了题目。
